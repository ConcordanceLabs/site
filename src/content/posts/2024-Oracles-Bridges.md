And bridges are oracles. 
These technolgies are abstractions of the same concept. All data not available native to a blockchain must be brought on chain my a trusted intermediary, be it a bridge, or an oracle. All are succespitable to liquidity pooling and hacks. 

Any technology built on top of ethereum does not have the ability to impact the ethereum network. 

Look at the top examples hacks, they are bridges and oracles. 

Furthermore, all bridges, oracles, etc are abstractions of the data problem on chain. Bringing data.
