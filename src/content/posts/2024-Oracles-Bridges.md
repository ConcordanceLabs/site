Blockchain solves for distributed compute. 
Everyone else is solving for data. 

Oracles bring data from web 2
Bridges bring data from other networks
L2s compress data from alterate networks to be verified by the L1s security model. 
And bridges are oracles. 
These technolgies are abstractions of the same concept; providing data not available native to a blockchain must be brought on chain my a trusted intermediary, be it a bridge, or an oracle. All are succespitable to liquidity pooling and hacks. 

The question then changes from how do we provide data to the native system while optimizing for certain constraints like, but instead the question is how do we remove the need for an intermediary to provide the data, and give users the ability to 

Any technology built on top of ethereum does not have the ability to impact the ethereum network. 

Look at the top examples hacks, they are bridges and oracles. 

Furthermore, all bridges, oracles, etc are abstractions of the data problem on chain. Bringing data. 


The Blockchain solves for has only solved for the ability to transition state in the face of bad actors compute. The most highly adopted system architecture for a decentralized Apps have an offchain routing and data storage component. 

This is because blockchain has to make certain assurances for users. A deterministic automata promises . Indeterminite automato creates opportunity for byzantine.
