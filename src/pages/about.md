We build for a feature-rich web without trusted intermediaries.

Founded on the belief that everyone has a right to transparency, Concordance is a public goods lab challenging the current paradigm of web infrastructure. We envision and design tools for a future where personal data never leaves the hand of its owner.
<!---
### Mission 
Blockchain is revolutionary for its research, discovery, and solutions in the fields of cryptography and distributed compute.
The conterporary web is interactive and blockchain (stack-based deterministic finite automata). 
This limits web3 builders, who design dApps with some blockchain compute for settlement, but then must fallback to web2 app architecture for the rest of the system model. This creates opacity and reintroduces centralization in an attempt to optimize the user experience. 

Concordance builds solutions that answer for the entire stack of web architecture, not through direct replication the design of web 2, but by first understanding the aims of the current system, and manufacturing anew according to these aims.   

__Concordance's misison is to create a stratum true alternate to web2 with offerings so superior, it would be determental for institutions not to adopt.__

### Vision
The Concordance was founded to address Web3 interactivity gap. We envision a world where personal data never sits inside a privately-owned server, where a business the power to send that data externally, make judgements on a person because of their biased algorithms, or alter pricing 

__We envision a world with transparancy, eliminating data leaks, abolishing direct data transmission, and randsomware becomes an issue of the past.__

Some of our boldest opinions can be found in our blog posts. 
We challenge the blockchain community not with citiques as a specator, but by entering the area and forging solutions that make the system stronger.
