Concordance is a public goods lab designing tools for a transparent and feature-rich web without trusted intermediaries. <br>


<!--### Mission Founded on the belief that everyone has a right to data transparency, Concordance is on a mission to address the Web3 Interactivity Gap.
-->
 <u>The Interactivity Gap:</u>

Web3 is revolutionary in its aim to enable a more secure and trustless online experience. <br>
To be a true alternative to the contemporary web, Web3 must have a way to natively enable state-independent features like search, streaming, or messaging for decentralized apps. Without it, builders are forced to default to web2 architecture, and in the process, reintroduce system opacity and data centralization. 

Concordance is closing the interactivity gap because we believe your personal data does not belong in a centralized server outside of your control.

 in the fields of cryptography and distributed compute.

Concordance builds solutions that answer for the entire stack of web architecture, not through direct replication the design of web 2, but by first understanding the aims of the current system, and manufacturing anew according to these aims.   


Concordance designs tools to free personal data siting inside a private server, owned by businesses who have the power to send that data externally, set pricing based on data they gathered without your consent, and make decisions to approve or deny you the resources and services you need because your data was processed through a biased algorithm.

### Vision

We envision a web with end-to-end transparancy for users, which eliminates data leaks and makes randsomware an issue of the past.
Concordance's belives in creting Web3 offerings so superior to Web2, it would be determental for developers and institutions not to adopt.

We challenge the blockchain community not with armchair critiques, but by entering the area and forging solutions that make the system stronger.
