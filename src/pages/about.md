We build for a feature-rich web without trusted intermediaries.

Concordance is a public goods lab challenging the current paradigm of web infrastructure. We envision and design tools for a future where personal data never lives outside of the control of the individual.

### Mission 

Founded on the belief that everyone has a right to transparency over their personal data, Concordance is on a mission to address the Web3 Interactivity Gap.
<br>

 <u>The Interactivity Gap:</u>

The Web3 industry is revolutionary in its progression of research, discovery, and products which enable a more secure and trustless web. <br>
But to be a true alternative to the contemporary web, Web3 must enable interactive data processing onchain, allowing Web3 builders to natively create applications with features such as search, streaming, or messaging. Builders currently fallback to web2 app architecture to build these interactive features. This architecture creates opacity in the system and reintroduces data centralization in an attempt to optimize the user experience. 


Concordance designs tools to free personal data siting inside a private server, owned by businesses who have the power to send that data externally, set pricing based on data they gathered without your consent, and make decisions to approve or deny you the resources and services you need because your data was processed through a biased algorithm.

 in the fields of cryptography and distributed compute.

Concordance builds solutions that answer for the entire stack of web architecture, not through direct replication the design of web 2, but by first understanding the aims of the current system, and manufacturing anew according to these aims.

### Vision

We envision a web with data transparancy for users, which eliminates data leaks and makes randsomware an issue of the past.

We challenge the blockchain community not with armchair critiques, but by entering the area and forging solutions that make the system stronger.
