We build for a feature rich blockchain without trusted intermidiaries. 

Founded on the belief that ____, Concordance is a public goods lab challenging the current paradigm of web infrastructure. We envision and design for an internet where personal data never leaves the hand of the owner.

Mission
Blockchain is revolutionary for its solutions in the distributed compute field.
For modern day apps, compute alone is not enough. 
Concordance's misison is to create a true alternate to web2 with offerings so superior to web2 that it would be determental not to adopt. Web3 must answer for the entire stack of web architecture, not through direct replication the design of web 2, but by first understanding the aims of the current system, and manufacturing anew according to these aims.   

The conterporary web is interactive. Stack-based deterministic finite automata is not enough to be a true alternative to web 2.0 without interactivity. This forces web apps to build with minimal blockchain compute, and primary offchain compute, leading to centralization for the sake of user experience. 

Vision
Concordance was founded to address web 3.0 interactivity gap. Some of our boldest opinions can be found in initial blog posts. We challenge the blockchain community not with specator opinions, but by entering the area. 

Intent-centric solution.
